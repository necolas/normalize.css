## The Compass port of normalize.css

__This project is the Sass/Compass port of normalize.css.__ It aims to use the best
partials from Compass to make normalize even easier to integrate with your
website. To learn about why Normalize.css is so amazing, skip to the
"normalize.css" section below.

This Sass/Compass port currently utilizes:

* Legacy IE support variables
* CSS3 Box Sizing mixin
* Vertical Rhythm mixins

In addition, Normalize.css has 2 major versions: version 2 (without legacy
browser support) and version 1 (with support for IE 6/7, etc.) This Compass port
combines the two versions into one file so that you can easily toggle between
the two versions using Compass' `$legacy-support-for-ie7` variable.

Did a client wait until the last minute to mention their CEO uses IE 7? Simply
set `$legacy-support-for-ie7` to `true` and recompile your Sass files.

# normalize.css v2

Normalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The project relies on researching the differences between default browser
styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from
normalizing.

## Install

Install using one of the following methods:

Download from the [project page](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass/).

Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save normalize.scss`

Install with [Component(1)](http://component.io/): `component install JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass`

## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle improvements.
* Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## How to use it

No other styles should come before Normalize.css.

For more information about how to use it, see the [About normalize.css article](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/).

To use the Compass port of Normalize, simply copy the _normalize.scss file to
your sass directory and follow the article's suggestions:

* __Approach 1:__ use _normalize.scss as a starting point for your own project's
base Sass, customising the values to match the design's requirements. (The best
approach, _IMO_.)
* __Approach 2:__ include _normalize.scss untouched and build upon it, overriding
the defaults later in your Sass if necessary.

## Browser support

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox 4+
* Apple Safari 5+
* Opera 12+
* Internet Explorer 8+
* Internet Explorer 6-7 (when `$legacy-support-for-ie7` or
`$legacy-support-for-ie6` is set to `true`)

[Normalize.css v1 provides legacy browser
support](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/tree/v1) (IE 6+, Safari 4+),
but is no longer actively developed.

## Other ports of Normalize.css

For the record, there are several other Sass or Compass ports as well.
Including:

* https://github.com/waynegraham/compass-normalize-plugin
* https://github.com/ksmandersen/compass-normalize
* https://github.com/hail2u/normalize.scss
* https://github.com/kristerkari/normalize.scss

Some of the above projects convert normalize into Sass mixins. That makes it
impossible to add Normalize using __Approach 1__ (by copying the file into your website
and customizing/overriding for your needs.)

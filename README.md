# normalize.css v2.1.1

Normalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. We researched the
differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only
the styles that need normalizing.

[Check out the demo](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/2.1.0/test.html)

[Legacy browser support is available in v1](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/tree/v1)

## Install

Download from the [project page](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

Install with [Bower](http://twitter.github.io/bower/): `bower install --save normalize-css`

## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle improvements.
* Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## How to use it

Normalize.css is intended to be used as an alternative to CSS resets.

It's suggested that you read the `normalize.css` file and consider customising
it to meet your needs. Alternatively, include the file in your project and
override the defaults later in your CSS.
